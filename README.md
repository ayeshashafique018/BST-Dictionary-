# Binary Search Tree (BST) Dictionary Management System

## Overview

This project is a Dictionary Management System developed using the Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure in C++. It allows users to efficiently store, retrieve, update, and delete dictionary entries. The system supports functionality for managing words, meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and different forms, leveraging the BST for optimized performance in operations like insertion, search, and deletion.

The dictionary entries are stored persistently in a file, ensuring data integrity even after system restarts. A simple console-based interface is provided to interact with the system.

## Features

1. **Insert Word**  
   Users can add new words with their meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and various forms.

2. **Search Word**  
   Users can search for a word and retrieve its meaning, synonyms, antonyms, and forms.

3. **Delete Word**  
   Users can delete a word from the dictionary.

4. **Update Word**  
   Users can update existing words by modifying their meaning, synonyms, antonyms, or forms.

5. **Display All Words**  
   Users can view all words in the dictionary with their respective details.

6. **Exit**  
   Users can exit the program.

## Tools and Technologies

- **C++ Programming Language**: The primary language used for developing the dictionary management system.
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Used for efficient storage and retrieval of dictionary entries.
- **File Handling in C++**: Employed for reading and writing dictionary data to a file for persistent storage.
- **Visual Studio IDE**: Used for coding, debugging, and building the application.

## Functional Requirements

- **Insert Word**: Adds a new word to the dictionary with its meaning, synonyms, antonyms, and forms.
- **Search Word**: Searches for a word and displays its details.
- **Delete Word**: Deletes an existing word from the dictionary.
- **Update Word**: Modifies an existing wordâ€™s details (meaning, synonyms, antonyms).
- **Display All Words**: Displays all words with their associated details.
- **Exit**: Exits the program.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The system should handle dictionary files efficiently, even with large datasets.
- **User-Friendliness**: The interface should be clear and intuitive with appropriate error messages.
- **Reliability**: The system should ensure that file I/O errors and unexpected inputs are handled gracefully.
- **Scalability**: The system should be modular and extensible for future enhancements.
- **Security**: Proper measures should be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to dictionary files.
- **Portability**: The system should be platform-independent.

## Project Scope

The project focuses on building a dictionary management system using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for efficient data handling. The key areas of focus are:

- Efficient storage and retrieval of dictionary entries.
- Update and deletion of dictionary words.
- Simple, user-friendly interface for interaction.
- Persistent storage of dictionary data via file handling.

## DSA Concepts Used

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: This is the core data structure used in the project to store dictionary entries. BSTs allow efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- **Tree Traversal**: Traversal methods (such as inorder) are used to display all dictionary entries in sorted order.
- **File Input/Output (I/O)**: C++ file handling features are used to read from and write to dictionary files for persistent storage.
- **Recursion**: Recursive methods are used for various tree operations, such as insertion, deletion, and search.

## Code Structure

- **DictionaryEntry struct**: Holds data for each dictionary entry, including the word, meaning, synonym, antonym, and forms.
- **BST Operations**: Functions like `insert()`, `search()`, `deleteWord()`, and `updateWord()` manipulate dictionary entries stored in the BST.
- **File I/O Functions**: Functions such as `readWordsFromFile()`, `writeEntriesToFile()`, and `createDictionaryEntryInFile()` handle reading from and writing to files.

## Example Usage

1. **Insert a Word**  
   Add a new word to the dictionary:


2. **Search for a Word**  
Search for an existing word and display its details:


3. **Update a Word**  
Update the definition of a word:


4. **Delete a Word**  
Delete a word from the dictionary:


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Binary Search Trees can be effectively used to manage and manipulate dictionary data. By implementing this system, we achieve efficient search, insertion, deletion, and updating operations, as well as providing persistent storage through file handling. The result is a robust and scalable dictionary management system that can be expanded with additional features in the future.
